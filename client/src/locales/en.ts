  "theory.title.1": "The Theory",
  "theory.title.2": "Explained",
  "theory.description":
    "Dr. Poplawski's theory merges Einstein's relativity with the concept of torsion to explain how universes might form inside black holes.",
  "theory.step1.title": "Matter Falls into a Black Hole",
  "theory.step1.description":
    "As matter gets pulled into a black hole, extreme gravitational forces compress it beyond our understanding of physics.",
  "theory.step2.title": "Spacetime Torsion",
  "theory.step2.description":
    "Unlike standard Einsteinian theory, Poplawski incorporates torsion - a twisting property of spacetime itself.",
  "theory.step3.title": "The Big Bounce",
  "theory.step3.description":
    "Instead of a singularity, torsion creates a repulsive force, causing matter to 'bounce' and expand outwards.",
  "theory.step4.title": "New Universe Formation",
  "theory.step4.description":
    "This expansion forms a new universe inside the black hole, separate yet connected to the parent universe.",
  "theory.implications": "Key Implications",
  "theory.implication1.title": "Infinite Regression",
  "theory.implication1.description":
    "Our universe could be in a black hole, which is in another universe, creating a potentially infinite chain.",
  "theory.implication2.title": "Explains Inflation",
  "theory.implication2.description":
    "The theory naturally accounts for cosmic inflation without needing additional hypothetical fields.",
  "theory.implication3.title": "No Beginning or End",
  "theory.implication3.description":
    "It challenges the Big Bang singularity idea with a 'bounce' mechanism that avoids a start time.",
  "theory.implication4.title": "Testable Predictions",
  "theory.implication4.description":
    "It makes predictions about the cosmic microwave background and gravitational waves that could be tested.",

  "visualizations.item2.title": "Torsion Mechanics",
  "visualizations.item2.description":
    "An illustration of how spacetime torsion works at a quantum level, causing a repulsive force as matter reaches extreme densities.",
