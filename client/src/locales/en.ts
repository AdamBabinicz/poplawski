  "theory.description":
    "Dr. Poplawski's theory merges Einstein's relativity with the concept of torsion to explain how universes might form inside black holes.",
  "theory.step1.title": "Matter Falls into a Black Hole",
  "theory.step1.description":
    "As matter gets pulled into a black hole, extreme gravitational forces compress it beyond our understanding of physics.",
  "theory.step2.title": "Spacetime Torsion",
  "theory.step2.description":
    "Unlike standard Einsteinian theory, Poplawski incorporates torsion - a twisting property of spacetime itself.",
  "theory.step3.title": "The Big Bounce",
  "theory.step3.description":
    "Instead of a singularity, torsion creates a repulsive force, causing matter to 'bounce' and expand outwards.",

  "theory.step4.description":
    "This expansion forms a new universe inside the black hole, separate yet connected to the parent universe.",

  "theory.implication1.description":
    "Our universe could be in a black hole, which is in another universe, creating a potentially infinite chain.",

  "theory.implication2.description":
    "The theory naturally accounts for cosmic inflation without needing additional hypothetical fields.",
  "theory.implication3.title": "No Beginning or End",
  "theory.implication3.description":
    "It challenges the Big Bang singularity idea with a 'bounce' mechanism that avoids a start time.",
