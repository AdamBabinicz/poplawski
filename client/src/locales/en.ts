  "theory.title.1": "The Theory",
  "theory.title.2": "Explained",
  "theory.description":
    "Dr. Popławski's theory brings together Einstein's theory of relativity and the concept of torsion to explain how universes might form inside black holes.",
  "theory.step1.title": "Matter Falls Into Black Hole",
  "theory.step1.description":
    "As matter is drawn into a black hole, extreme gravitational forces compress it beyond our understanding of physics.",
  "theory.step2.title": "Spacetime Torsion",
  "theory.step2.description":
    "Unlike in Einstein's theory, Popławski includes the concept of torsion - a twisting property of spacetime itself.",
  "theory.step3.title": "The Big Bounce",
  "theory.step3.description":
    'Instead of a singularity, torsion creates a repulsive force causing matter to "bounce" and expand outward.',
  "theory.step4.title": "New Universe Forms",
  "theory.step4.description":
    "This expansion creates a new universe inside the black hole, separated from but connected to its parent universe.",
  "theory.implications": "Key Implications",
  "theory.implication1.title": "Infinite Regression",
  "theory.implication1.description":
    "Our universe may be inside a black hole, which exists in another universe, creating a potentially infinite chain.",
  "theory.implication2.title": "Explains Inflation",
  "theory.implication2.description":
    "The theory naturally explains cosmic inflation without needing additional hypothetical fields.",
  "theory.implication3.title": "No Beginning or End",
  "theory.implication3.description":
    'Challenges the Big Bang singularity idea with a "bounce" mechanism that avoids a beginning of time.',
  "theory.implication4.title": "Testable Predictions",
  "theory.implication4.description":
    "Makes predictions about cosmic microwave background radiation and gravitational waves that could be tested.",

  "visualizations.item1.description":

  "visualizations.item2.title": "Torsion Mechanics",
  "visualizations.item2.description":
    "Illustration of how spacetime torsion works at the quantum level, causing a repulsive force when matter reaches extreme density.",
